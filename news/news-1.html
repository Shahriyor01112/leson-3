      Minister of Environment summoned to Parliament to comment on capital’s air
      pollution
    </h1>
    <p>
      At the meeting held on January 17, the Legislative Chamber of Oliy Majlis
      decided to summon the Minister of Ecology, Environmental Protection and
      Climate Change, Aziz Abdukhakimov, to provide information about the work
      being done to prevent air pollution in Uzbekistan, including the city of
      Tashkent. Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber, Chairman of the
      Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, Head of the faction of
      the Ecology Party Khayrullo Gafforov noted that air pollution in the
      capital has recently become a topic of discussion. Referring to Uzhydromet
      data, he reported that the average amount of fine PM2.5 particles in the
      air in Tashkent in January was 45 μg/m3, which is several times higher
      than the recommendations of the World Health Organization (5 μg/m3). He
      also reminded that the city of Tashkent has the highest level of air
      pollution in the world. According to him, despite the adoption of the Law
      “On protection of atmospheric air” in 2019, the situation is getting
      worse. Therefore, it was decided to call the Minister of Ecology,
      Environmental Protection and Climate Change Aziz Abdukhakimov to the
      parliament to report. Khayrullo Gafforov stated that, in addition to
      listening to the report, the Legislative Chamber has the right to propose
      to the president the expediency of the resignation of government members,
      the prosecution of individuals, and the dismissal of government members.
      According to him, the hearing will be conducted in a “serious manner”.
      Also, at the extended meeting of the faction, a working group was formed,
      which will listen to the opinions of scientists and study the problem on
      the spot.
